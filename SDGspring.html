    <h2>SPRING GUIDE</h2>

      <p><p id="generaladvice"><b>General Advice</b></p>
      <ol type="1">
	<li>Throughout your first year, any time you pass by someone make sure to talk to them for friendship points.</li>
	<li>Never dig through the trash when someone is looking.</li>
        <li>Always dig through the trash when no one is looking.</li>
	<li>As the month progresses you will likely find carrot seeds in artifact spots and in the mines. You may also find rice shoots in fishing chests or the mines. Plant all carrot seeds and rice shoots you find, as they give large amounts of farming experience. When you harvest carrots, make sure to put one in the shipping bin but keep the rest to eat in the mines. Keep all normal quality unmilled rice and sell the silver and gold star quality.</li>
        <li>Rainy Spring days are extremely lucrative fishing days because you can catch catfish in the river. If a rainy day falls on a day when you're supposed to go to the mines, consider fishing instead and going to the mines on the next scheduled fishing day. Try to stick to major events like birthday gifts, tool upgrades, or donations regardless of weather.</li>
        <li> It's a good idea to pick an out of the way spot on your farm to continuously plant a supply of new trees to chop down. Later on in the summer, you will likely start to run out of sources of wood. Any time you're instructed to chop wood on your farm, replant seeds in that spot.</li>
      </ol></p>

      <p><p id="day1"><b>Spring 1, Monday</b></p>
      <ol type="1">
	<li>Clear some weeds, wood, and stone close to your farmhouse and plant free parsnip seeds. Make sure there is at least one clear space between the closest weeds, wood, or stone and your parsnips, as those items can spread and ruin your crops.</li>
	<li>Chop 50 wood to make a chest, prioritizing wood and trees that will make a wider path down to Cindersap Forest or up to the backwoods. Put the chest close to your farmhouse and deposit everything except your scythe and hoe into the chest.</li>
	<li>Go to Pierre’s (pick up any forage items and dig artifact spots along the way) and buy the following seeds: 2 bean starters, 4 cauliflower, 2 jazz.</li>
	<li>Pick all the spring onion in the Cindersap Forest.</li>
	<li>Go back to your farm and put one spring onion in the shipping bin.</li>
	<li>Plant the seeds from Pierre’s, as well as any mixed seeds you have.</li>
	<li>Chop wood until you can make a second chest specifically for cooking items and put it in your farmhouse.</li>
	<li>Cut all the fiber on your farm and plant all the mixed seeds you find.</li>
	<li>Sell any remaining spring onions and go to bed.</li>
      </ol></p>

      <p><p id="day2"><b>Spring 2, Tuesday</b></p>
      <ol type="1">
	<li>Read the letters in your mailbox.</li>
	<li>Plant any seeds you couldn’t plant yesterday and water your crops.</li>
	<li>Put everything in your chest so your bag is empty, and don't pick up any forage items today.</li>
	<li>Get the fishing rod from Willy, and fish at the mountain lake all day, replenishing your energy as needed with the highest quality chubs you catch, or algae.</li>
	  <ul><li>I found some extremely good fishing tips in <a href="https://autosaved.org/stardew-valley-first-six-days-guide">this guide</a>, including the best spots to fish from at the lake and river. This guide has a lot of great general tips, and I included quite a few in my own guide here. It's well worth a read.</li></ul>
	<li>If inventory management becomes a problem, you can run back to your farm to drop off fish, but try not to waste time doing it until after 7pm if you don’t have to. If you plan on playing at least 2 more days, don’t drop stuff off at all. Just drop extra items on the ground, making sure to stand slightly back from the edge while you fish so your dropped items don’t fall in the water. You will retrieve them on Thursday.</li>
	<li>If you aren’t fishing level two by the end of the day, start the day over and try again. If you don’t end the day with all the fish you need in storage, don’t worry. There will be more opportunities to get them.</li>
	<li>Keep your largest stack of chub in storage to bring to the mines as food later. Also put away anything you need from your checklists. Put everything else in the shipping bin and go to bed.</li>
      </ol></p>

    <p><p id="day3"><b>Spring 3, Wednesday</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>Bring only your fishing rod and don't pick up any forage items today.</li>
	<li>Go fishing at the town river. At 2:30, go back to your farm to drop off the fish on your checklist, eat the smallmouth bass until your energy is full, and sell everything else.</li>
	<li>Go fishing at the ocean until you have caught 3 eels.</li>
	<li>Go back to the river and fish for the rest of the night.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p><p id="day4"><b>Spring 4, Thursday</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>Water crops and chop enough wood to make another chest. Move your crafting materials into it.</li>
	<li>Bring your fishing rod and your hoe for hitting artifact spots and go to town. 
	<li>Go to Pierre’s to buy the backpack. If it’s not 9:00 AM yet, take a little extra time to look for forage items at the bus stop and by the community center while you wait. </li>
	<li>If it’s sunny, catch the sunfish you need at the river first, then pick up forage items at the beach and fish off the docks for the rest of the day. If it's raining, fish at the town river all day.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p><p id="day5"><b>Spring 5, Friday</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>Congratulations! You're a father! Say yes to your pet and give it a name. Don't forget to pet and water it every day because it'll drop useful stuff when it likes you.</li>
	<li>Harvest your parsnips and store all gold and silver star quality parsnips. Keep 1 lowest quality for the community center and 2 lowest quality for cooking. Sell one lowest quality in the shipping bin. Keep the rest of the lowest quality in your inventory to restore energy in the mines.</li>
	<li>Harvest anything else that's ready and store anything on the checklist. Sell the rest.</li>
	<li>Check the traveling cart for Year Two crops and seeds.</li>
	<li>Go to town from your farm via the bus stop. If the community center cutscene triggers, go inside and interact with the plaque on the floor after the cutscene is done.</li>
	<li>Go to Pierre’s and buy 4 potato, 4 tulips, 3 kale, and enough parsnip seeds to fill the rest of the empty spaces you have. Then go back to the farm and plant them.</li>
	<li>Empty everything out of your inventory except your pickaxe and fish or carrots for the mine. If you don't have very many fish or carrots, you can bring your stack of normal quality parsnips as well.</li>
	<li>Go to Robin’s shop, picking up edible forage items along the way, and move your pet’s food bowl to a more convenient location if needed. I like to put it right next to the farmhouse so it's easy to pour water into every day. I also like to move my farmhouse back against the fence so there isn't a gap of empty space behind it.</li>
	<li>Go to the mines and start heading down.</li>
          <ol><li>Try to avoid slimes (time wasters) but fight everything else you find. Bugs are one shot, give you bug meat for bait, and when you beat the monster slayer goal you get a good sword. Rock crabs can drop crabs when killed, allowing you to finish the crab pot bundle in the community center without having to actually craft a crab pot. Duggies sometimes drop bombs which can be used to progress through the mine quickly. But the slimes take forever to kill with the starter sword so avoid fighting them until you find a better weapon.</li>
	<li>Try to collect as much copper as you can without fighting monsters. Once you get a more powerful sword, you can start fighting them.</li></ol>
        <li>When you get home, put one bug meat in the shipping bin and check it off the list.</li>
	<li>Save 10 bug meat to make a steak when you get the recipe. Turn the rest of your bug meat into bait and store it.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p><p id="day6"><b>Spring 6, Saturday</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>Craft a furnace and start smelting your copper ore.</li>
	<li>Craft a scarecrow and place it near your crops.</li>
	<li>Water your crops.</li>
	<li>Smelt some more copper.</li>
	<li>Pack your bag with: Sword, pickaxe, and parsnips and fish you have for the mines.</li>
	<li>If you didn't get the Community Center cutscene yesterday, go to town via the bus stop after 8am to trigger it and read the plaque on the floor.</li>
	<li>Go to the mines and collect more copper ore.</li>
	<li>Before you go to bed, put more copper in the smelter.</li>
    </ol></p>

	<li>Talk to the Wizard to gain the ability to read the junimo floor plaques.</li>
	<li>Give a gift to Lewis at his manor.</li>

	<li>Go back to your farm and put some more copper in the smelter.</li>
	<li>Put away extra items and plant any seeds you can, including any free seeds you got from the museum. If you have at least 50 sap in storage, make enough fertilizer to use on the seeds you just planted.</li>
	<li>Put some more copper in the smelter.</li>
	<li>Bring your fishing rod and hoe and fish for the rest of the day. If you are missing any fish that you need, go get them now. Then if it's rainy, fish at the town river for the rest of the day. If it's sunny fish at the lake until 7PM and fish at lv 20 of the mines after that (if you haven't reached lv 20 then just continue to fish at the lake).</li>
	<li>Put some more copper in the smelter before you go to bed.</li>
