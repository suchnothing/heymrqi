    <h2>WINTER GUIDE</h2>

      <p><p id="generaladvice"><b>General Advice</b></p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>This month will be all about setting yourself up to make mad money in Year 2. This means you need to finish getting full hearts with everyone you can so that you don't have to spend as much time on it, make some important upgrades to improve farm profits, and collect as much iridium ore as possible.</li>
      <li>You will need at least 96 iridium bars for upgrading, crafting, and building. For the entire Winter season, smelt iridium whenever you can. If you surpass 96 bars, keep smelting it and sell the extra bars. Once you reach 20 iridium bars, make sure to keep that number in your chest at all times, as you'll need 20 at the end of the month to make sprinklers.</li>
      <li>You'll need at least 60 gold bars for crafting. Any time you run out of iridium to smelt, smelt gold instead. Once you have 60 bars in storage, you can keep smelting it and sell the extra bars. Smelting iridium takes higher priority, as it's more valuable. Put something in the smelter first thing in the morning, and last thing before bed. ABS. Always Be Smelting.</li>
      <li>You'll be spending significantly more time on the Community Board quests now, because you need to complete a bunch of them to get all the recipes you need for perfection. Prioritize quests that you haven't done yet, especially those which will give you a new recipe.</li>
      <li>You will likely unlock the mastery cave this season, which happens when all your skills reach max level. When you start getting mastery levels and can choose which profession to level up, do farming first, mining second, and combat third. You can do the last two in whatever order you want. As soon as you reach farming mastery, craft a statue of blessing. As soon as you reach mining mastery, craft a statue of the dwarf king (take care not to use the 20 iridium bars you need to make your sprinklers).</li>
      </ol></p>

      <p><p id="day1"><b>Winter 1, Monday</b> (Krobus' Birthday)</p>
      <ol type="1">
	<li>Chop down your apple tree, and any other fruit trees you have planted outside, and replant them in the greenhouse.</li>
	<li>Move all but two of your sprinklers into the greenhouse and plant your starfruit. You'll need 16 quality sprinklers in total, so make more if you need to.</li>
	<li>Plant your starfruit seeds in the greenhouse. Don't forget to keep 2 sprinklers open, one for ancient fruit and the other for any other random crops you may still be missing.</li>
	<li>Plant any powdermelon seeds you have next to the sprinklers outside.</li>
	<li>Bring gifts to everyone you don’t have full hearts with (not including Sandy).</li>
	<li>Don’t forget to bring Krobus a pumpkin for his birthday.</li>
	<li>Go to the bus stop to trigger the cutscene with the little shadow guy. Look for their footprints near the fountain/playground to get their note-finding ability.</li>
	<li>Get a quest from the community board.</li>
	<li>Go fishing at the lake for a lingcod and perch. Keep the lingcod for a quest later, and sell the perch.</li>
	<li>If you have extra time, run around the valley looking for winter forage and powdermelon seeds.</li>
      </ol></p>

	<li>Buy the dehydrator recipe from Pierre.</li>
	<li>Work on your community board quest.</li>
	<li>If you can't work on the quest, or if you complete it, run around looking for forage, or go fishing at the lake.</li>
	<li>Before you go to bed, craft a dehydrator and put the 5 grapes you saved inside.</li>
      </ol></p>

    <p><p id="day3"><b>Winter 3, Wednesday</b> (Linus' Birthday)</p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>Collect your raisins and put them in the shipping bin. Put the 5 spiceberries you saved into the dehydrator.</li>
	<li>Put your dino egg in your donations chest for the museum and hand it in next time you go.</li>
	<li>If you got a void egg today, make it into mayo.</li>
	<li>Pack your bag with: Sword, pickaxe, hoe, food, and a gift for Linus and Sandy.</li>
	<li>Bring Linus a gift for his birthday (if you don’t already have 10 hearts).</li>
	<li>Go to the desert and give a gift to Sandy. Pick up all the coconuts you find and save them for Ginger Island.</li>
	<li>Go to the Skull Cavern for the rest of the day. Before you leave, make sure to stock up on totems if you found enough omni geodes. If you happened to find any ruby, you should also trade for 1 or 2 spicy eel, as they're very useful for getting through the Skull Cavern quickly.</li>
	<li>If you get an amethyst in the Skull Cavern, save it for a quest.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p><p id="day4"><b>Winter 4, Thursday</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>Collect the dried spice berries and put them in the shipping bin. Put the 5 common mushrooms you saved into the dehydrator.</li>

	<li>Go fishing at the ocean until 11PM. Keep 1 squid for a quest and 1 to make bait for Squidfest.</li>
	<li>At 11PM, go to the Saloon and buy the maki recipe from Gus. When you get home, use a low quality fish from today, like sardine or herring, and the seaweed you would have saved in an earlier season to make maki. Remember that cooking draws ingredients from the bottom right of your inventory first, so put your desired fish ingredient in the bottom right corner to avoid consuming a fish you don't intend to use. Put the maki in your donations chest and go to bed.</li>

    <ol type="1">

	<li>Check the traveling cart if you still need Year 2 crops.</li>

	<li>Bring gifts to anyone else who isn’t full hearts.</li>
	<li>Go to Robin's and build a second barn.</li>

    <ol type="1">
	<li>Harvest and replant powdermelon. Sell it all.</li>
	<li>Chop wood or gather forage until the festival of ice begins.</li>

    <p><p id="day10"><b>Winter 10, Wednesday</b> (Sebastian's Birthday)</p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>Pack your bag with: Sword, pickaxe, hoe, food (including spicy eel), a desert totem, and a gift for Sandy (and Sebastian if you aren't max hearts).</li>

	<li>Check fruit cave.</li>
	<li>Pack your bag with: Fishing rod, hoe, bait maker, squid bait, and a void essence.</li>
	<li>Check the traveling cart if you still need Year 2 crops.</li>
	<li>Bring the void essence to Wizard.</li>
	<li>Go fishing at the ocean for squid as part of squid fest. Don’t make more bait unless you run out, as you want to keep as many squid as possible. You will need 1 for cooking and 1 for a quest, but the rest can be made into calamari for Pierre or sold.</li>
	<li>If Willy is out fishing, give him one of your squid to complete his quest.</li>
	<li>When you've caught 8 squid, go get your prizes and head back to your farm to drop everything off. Keep the Dish o' the Sea to help you catch the glacierfish. Keep the coffee to turn into espresso, as it'll sell for more that way. I like to stash all my coffee until I get the cooking quest from Qi. Do whatever you want with the rest of the prizes.</li>

    <ol type="1">
	<li>Make as many kegs as you can and put them in the greenhouse.</li>
	<li>Your starfruit should be ready so harvest and replant it. Fill as many kegs as you can, starting with normal quality fruits before moving on to higher quality. Save the rest of the fruit to put in the kegs when the first batch is done.</li>

	<li>Pack your bag with: Fishing rod, hoe, 2 trap bobbers, your highest quality bait, the seafoam pudding and dish o' the sea that you got from Squidfest, and a rabbit's foot. Note that if you haven't found Secret Note #20 you won't be able to fulfill the rabbit's foot exchange yet, and can skip that part.</li>

	<li>Pick up weekly quest at the Community Board.</li>
	<li>Go to Cindersap Forest and fish for the glacierfish using a trap bobber and the seafoam pudding. When you catch it, head back to your farm and put it in the fish smoker.</li>
	<li>If you have time, pick up whatever tools or resources you might need and work on your weekly quest until 3PM.</li>
	<li>At 3PM go to the Saloon and buy the cooking recipes from Gus. Then go back to your farm and drop off anything you don't need.</li>
	<li>Bring your fishing rod, hoe, trap bobbers, bait, and a farm totem (if you have some) to the beach for the night market. You want to already be there when it opens to maximize your time, so don't worry if you're a bit early. Just hang around until it opens.</li>
	<li>Pick up any nautilus shells on the beach. Don't pick up anything else, as you'll need lots of inventory space.</li>
	<li>You can watch the mermaid show and then solve the puzzle to get a pearl if you want, but you don’t have to. I personally think it's a bit of a waste of time.</li>
	<li>Check the traveling cart and merchant for any seeds you need. If you don't need any seeds or items, you can skip them.</li>
	<li>Go fishing in the submarine to catch an octopus (if you didn't get one in the summer), spookfish, midnight squid, and blobfish. You should smoke the blobfish before selling them to increase their value.</li>
	<li>If you were able to bring a farm totem, fish until 1AM and then warp home. If not, start heading back up at 12AM.</li>

	<li>Pack your bag with the following Community Center donations: winter root, crystal fruit, snow yam, crocus, maple syrup, fiddlehead fern, truffle, poppy, maki roll, fried egg, red mushroom, sea urchin, sunflower, duck feather, aquamarine, red cabbage, purple mushroom, nautilus shell, chub, frozen geode, oak resin, wine, rabbit's foot, and pomegranate.</li>
	<li>Donate them to complete the Community Center.</li>
	<li>Go back to your farm to drop off Community Center prizes. You can sell the winter seeds and the pink cakes. Keep the recycling machine and seed maker. Keep or sell the 5 gold bars depending on whether or not you need them.</li>
	<li>Work on the Community Board quest until 3PM, or go fishing at the lake.</li>
	<li>At 3PM go back to your farm to drop off anything you don't need. You should still have trap bobbers from yesterday. Bring all the same fishing gear and a farm totem (if you have one) and go back to the night market.</li>

    <ol type="1">
	<li>If you were able to plant ancient fruit on the first day of having your greenhouse, it should be ready to pick. Put 1 lowest quality fruit in the shipping bin, keep any gold star quality until you have 5 for the Joja Mart community bundle, and turn the rest into seeds. There will now be fruit available once every week. Fill any remaining spaces on your non-starfruit sprinkler spaces with more ancient fruit. Once that sprinkler is full, keep making seeds with the fruit you pick and store them for later.</li>
	<li>Move your pig into the second barn.</li>
	<li>If you aren't full hearts after finishing the bulletin board bundles, bring a gift to Wizard for his birthday.</li>
	<li>Go to Marnie's and buy a heater for the second barn (if you need one) and 2 auto-grabbers, one for the first barn and one for the coop. You won't need one for the second barn. After making those purchases, buy as many pigs as you can afford to fill it up.</li>
	<li>Go home to pet all your new pigs and place the auto-grabbers. You no longer need your milking pail and shears.</li>
	<li>Pack your bag with whatever you need for your quest or fishing, an iron bar for Clint, an amethyst for Emily, and gifts for anyone you aren't max hearts with. If you have less than 1000g left after buying the pigs, then also bring any extra gems you've been saving to give as gifts so you can sell them to Clint, as you likely won't need them anymore. You can also bring some gold bars to sell to him and replenish them later, if you don't have enough gems and need the cash to pay the submarine man.</li>
	<li>Enter the town from the bus stop to trigger the completed Community Center scene. Incite an act of physical violence against Morris. Do it for George. He loves it.</li>
	<li>Give gifts to everyone you can that isn't full hearts.</li>
	<li>Give the amethyst to Emily.</li>
	<li>Give the iron bar to Clint and try to pretend you didn't just screw him.</li>
	<li>Work on your quest or fish at the lake until 3PM.</li>

    <ol type="1">
	<li>You should hopefully be finished the community center by now. If not, focus on finishing your weekly quest and exploring Skull Cavern, and come back to the instructions on this day after you've finished the Community Center. In the future, you'll be alternating time at Ginger Island and Skull Cavern, so when the community center is done you can do all Ginger Island to catch up.</li>
	<li>Pack your bag with: fishing rod, hoe, a void mayo, 200 hardwood, 5 iridium bars, and 5 batteries.</li>
	<li>Go to the train station for the witch cutscene.</li>
	<li>Go to Willy’s and fix the boat to Ginger Island.</li>
	<li>Go talk to Krobus and retrieve the key from the mutant bug lair. Catch a slimejack while you’re there.</li>
	<li>If you still have space in your second barn, go to Marnie's and buy more pigs with your submarine fish earnings from yesterday. You want the entire barn to be full of only pigs so keep buying more until it's full.</li>
	<li>Open the witch cave and catch a void salmon. Save the salmon for the Joja bundle.</li>
	<li>Bribe the little goblin with some void mayo and go get the ink for Wizard. You can take the shortcut from the Witch's lair to Wizard's tower. Kinda sus that this exists tbh.</li>

Leave 11 coconuts behind for crafting and building. I also like to bring my OG scythe to leave on the island in case I find myself with something that needs scything when I've left the good one at home.</li>

	<li>Save the dino egg in the egg chest to put in the incubator when the other one hatches.</li>
	<li>Place the new kegs in the greenhouse. You can now place kegs next to your fully grown fruit trees, but be careful not to put fruit in the kegs as you gather it from the trees. The kegs need to stay empty until you make your next batch of starfruit wine. You can sell the tree fruit unless you need it for gifts.</li>
	<li>Collect the starfruit wine and refill the kegs with your saved starfruit starting with the lowest quality first. You can sell the wine and any remaining starfruit, as new fruit will be ready soon.</li>
	<li>If you aren't max hearts with Leah, bring her a gift for her birthday.</li>
	<li>Pick up the weekly quest.</li>
	<li>If you have golden coconuts from Ginger Island, now is a good time to break them open.</li>
	<li>Give gifts to anyone you aren't full hearts with.</li>
	<li>Work on your weekly quest, or go to the Skull Cavern.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p><p id="day24"><b>Winter 24, Wednesday</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>Bring 110 pieces of hardwood to Robin's, upgrade your farmhouse, and give the leftover 10 pieces to Robin.</li>
	<li>Give gifts to everyone you're not full hearts with (except Sandy and Leo).</li>
	<li>Work on your weekly quest, or go to the Skull Cavern.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p><p id="day25"><b>Winter 25, Thursday</b> (Feast of the Winter Star)</p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>Pack your bag with: Sword, pickaxe, ax, hoe, food, the gift you're going to give at the feast today, and all your tree seeds (not including mahogany).</li>
	<li>Go to the quarry until noon. Break as many rocks and chop as many trees as you can. When everything is cleared, plant rows of trees that can grow next season and provide a ton of wood for kegs and other crafting projects. But mostly for kegs.</li>
	<li>At noon, take the minecart to town for the Feast of the Winter Star. Talk to everyone, give your secret gift, ruin Christmas for Pierre by buying nothing, and then leave.</li>
	<li>You probably didn't manage to finish everything at the quarry, so head back there and continue to work on it until bedtime. Don't worry if you don't finish clearing everything and planting seeds everywhere. You don't have to go back and finish later. The main goal is just to have some wood in storage and some new wood growing.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p><p id="day26"><b>Winter 26, Friday</b> (Clint's Birthday)</p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>Collect oak resin and put it in your crafting chest.</li>
	<li>Pack your bag with: Sword, pickaxe, hoe, spicy eel, food, items to trade for desert totems and more spicy eel if you need them, and a gift for Sandy (if you aren't already max hearts).</li>
	<li>Trade for totems or spicy eel if you need it.</li>
        <li>Go to Sandy's and buy 92 starfruit seeds for tomorrow. Also buy 480 rhubarb seeds to plant the first day of spring. It may cost you 48,000 gold, but you'll get half a million back when it's done growing so it's worth it.</li>
        <li>If you have a tendency to get knocked out in the mines, you may want to pop home to drop off your seeds. If you like to live dangerously, proceed directly to the Skull Cavern for the rest of the day.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p><p id="day27"><b>Winter 27, Saturday</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>Craft more kegs for the greenhouse if you have the materials.</li>
	<li>Save the dino egg in the egg chest to put in the incubator when the other one hatches.</li>
	<li>Harvest and replant your starfruit and put it all in your greenhouse chest to make more wine when the current batch is done. Place the kegs but don't fill them until the rest are ready.</li>
	<li>Finish your weekly quest or go to the Skull Cavern.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p><p id="day28"><b>Winter 28, Sunday</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>Craft a gate and bring materials to enclose the pigs with a fence. I recommend stone as you probably have a lot by now and you won't need it all. But you can choose whatever material you want. Place the gate and build the fence.</li>
	<li>You need 20 iridium sprinklers. Craft as many as you need (or as many as you can) and put them where you want to plant. Also place the 2 quality sprinklers you've had outdoors somewhere on the farm.</li>
	<li>Arrange your impressive scarecrow collection around the sprinklers to protect your crops from winged thieves.</li>
	<li>Put the following in your shipping bin: 1 iridium bar, 1 iridium ore.</li>
	<li>Craft the winter seeds and put them in the shipping bin.</li>
	<li>Let's do some spring cleaning! Sell all the gifts you were keeping for people who are now at max hearts. Keep 51 void essence and 103 solar essence for crafting and sell the rest. Any additional essences you get can be sold going forward.</li>
	<li>If you accidentally sold your albacore like I did, go catch one now and give it to Gus.</li>
	<li>Give gifts to anyone you aren't max hearts with (not including Sandy and Leo).</li>
	<li>If you still have time, finish your weekly quest or go to Skull Cavern.</li>
