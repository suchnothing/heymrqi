    <h2>SUMMER GUIDE</h2>

      <p><p id="generaladvice"><b>General Advice</b></p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>You may get green rain one day this month. When it happens, abandon all other plans and harvest moss. Chop down 3 or 4 giant ferns, but don't waste time chopping down trees. Whatever plans got abandoned, pick up necessary ones (like big purchases or upgrades) the next day.</li>
      <li>On the first day of normal rain, go to the beach before 7pm to catch 1 red snapper. Fit the rest of your day around it however it makes sense.</li>
      <li>After donating all the dwarf scrolls, the next time you go to the mines open her shop and buy new recipes and books from her.</li>
      <li>As you collect forage items, make sure to keep 5 grapes and 5 of another forage fruit for the dehydrator. All 5 need to be the same quality.</li>
      </ol></p>

      <p><p id="day1"><b>Summer 1, Monday</b></p>
      <ol type="1">
	<li>Put some iron in the smelters.</li>
	<li>By now you will hopefully have the ability to make quality sprinklers. Make up to 10 sprinklers and place them in a convenient spot. If you can’t make them all, plant your crops as if there will be sprinklers then just continue to make more as you get the materials until all your crops are being watered.</li>
	<li>Till and water enough spaces for all the sprinklers.</li>
	<li>Put some iron in the smelters.</li>
	<li>Go to Pierre’s and buy 8 melon (you should have 9 at home from the community center), 3 tomato, 4 blueberries, 6 pepper, 17 wheat, 4 radish, 16 poppies, 8 spangle, 1 hops, and 8 sunflower. Also get 1 apple sapling.</li>
	<li>Save one of the melon seeds and one of the wheat seeds for a quest later. Plant 8 wheat, 2 radish, 8 poppies, and the rest of the seeds you bought. Save the extra wheat, radish, and poppy seeds for when they're ready to harvest and replant.</li>
        <li>If you have coffee or squash seeds, make another sprinkler to plant them next to.</li>
	<li>Put quality fertilizer on the melon seeds. If you have extra quality fertilizer, put it on your starfruit seeds.</li>
	<li>If you have lots of sap, put regular fertilizer on the flower, hot pepper, and blueberry seeds.</li>
	<li>Put some iron in the smelters.</li>
	<li>Find somewhere convenient but relatively out of the way to plant your apple sapling.</li>
	<li>Gather wood for the rest of the day. At this point you should have made all your sprinklers and still have at least 25 copper bars and at least 2 iron bars in storage. If you don't, then keep going back to the smelters while chopping to refill them until you have what you need.</li>
	<li>If you can, make a worm bin. Upgrade it to a deluxe after the green rain day. If you can't make a worm bin right now, make one as soon as you have the materials. Prioritize making the sprinklers first.</li>
	<li>If you need smelted materials put it in the smelters before you go to bed.</li>
      </ol></p>

      <p><p id="day2"><b>Summer 2, Tuesday</b></p>
      <ol type="1">
	<li>Put some iron in the smelters.</li>
	<li>Pack your bag with: Fishing rod, hoe, pickaxe, 5 copper bars, and gifts for Evelyn, George, Pierre, Caroline, Abigail, Maru, Harvey, Demetrius, Lewis, Alex, Clint, and Penny. If you have room to bring museum donations or geodes (don't forget to save 1 frozen geode), bring those as well.</li>
	<ol><li>Bring a normal quality parsnip for anyone you don't have a loved gift for (double check that they don't hate it first).</li></ol>
	<li>Before you drop off your pickaxe, make sure you have at least 200 stone in storage. If you don't, gather the stone first.</li>
	<li>Give gifts to Evelyn and George at their house. If you get there early enough (before they open) you may be able to catch Alex leaving the house and skip going to the beach to get him.</li>
        <li>Give gifts to Pierre, Caroline, and Abigail at the general store.</li>
        <li>Give gifts to Maru and Harvey at the clinic.</li>

	<li>Go to Clint's and upgrade your pickaxe. Open geodes if you brought them.</li>
	<li>Give a gift to Clint.</li>
	<li>Make museum donations if you have any.</li>

	<li>Fish at the Cindersap river until 6PM, then switch to fishing off the docks. If you're running low on space, leave the river at 5:30PM and drop stuff off at your farm. Save one rainbow trout to make bait later. Save one fish roe for tomorrow.</li>
	<li>Put some iron in the smelters before you go to bed.</li>
      </ol></p>

	<li>Put some iron in the smelters.</li>
        <li>Pack your bag with: Fishing rod, hoe, 300 wood, 100 stone, and gifts for Robin, Linus, and Sebastian. Sebastian doesn't like parsnip so you should consider bringing him a frozen tear if you've collected a bunch. Don't worry too much about taking one out of your building chest for him, as you'll likely find many more before you need them.</li>
	<li>Go to Robin’s and build a coop.</li>
	<li>Give a gift to Robin.</li>
	<li>Give a gift to Linus by the lake.</li>
	<li>Fish at the lake. Smoke 1 sturgeon for the Luau and keep 3 uncooked.</li>
