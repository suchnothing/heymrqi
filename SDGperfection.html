    <h2>Reach Perfection</h2>

      <p><p id="generaladvice"><b>General Advice</b></p>
      <ol type="1">
	<li>At this point, all that's left is to get those final few friends to max hearts, tie up some loose ends, and make a lot of money.</li>
	<li>The first time it rains pick up a marriage pendant from the weirdo near the beach tidepools and give it to the person you want to marry. Unless you're going the Krobus route, in which case as soon as he is at max hearts you can get his item from the Desert Trader and give it to him.</li>
	<li>The next time the book seller is in town, buy all the remaining special ability books, as well as the Queen of Sauce if it's available. If you can't get the cook book this time, get it the next time the book seller comes.</li>
      </ol></p>

      <p><p id="money"><b>Make Money</b></p>
        Reaching perfection requires building all 4 warp obelisks and the golden clock, which costs a total of 13 million gold. This is the most challenging part of reaching perfection. Hopefully you're now well set up to rake in money so that you can buy the buildings before the end of year 2.
      <ol type="1">
	<li><b>Crops:</b> Your most important money-maker is going to be crops. That's why you've crafted 20 iridium sprinklers. Plant rhubarb in Spring, starfruit in summer, and pumpkins in fall. Continue harvesting and replanting starfruit in your greenhouse across all seasons. Once you've grown all the special year 2 crops and you know you aren't missing anything from other seasons, you can start planting starfruit on that greenhouse sprinkler as well. Keep the ancient fruit sprinkler.</li>
	<li><b>Kegs:</b> Increase the value of your crops by making as many of them as possible into wine or juice with the kegs. Every time you get more oak resin, make more kegs and slowly fill up empty space in your greenhouse, your farmhouse, and even your Ginger Island sleep hut if you run out space on the valley farm. Prioritize making starfruit wine, but when you run out of startfruit from the greenhouse you can use the crops you've grown outside. Always put the lowest quality in the kegs first, and when you get close to harvesting another batch of produce you can sell the high quality ones left over that you weren't able to put into the kegs.</li>
	<li><b>Truffles:</b> Your 12 pigs should each produce 1 or 2 truffles each every day (unless it's raining). Make sure to pet the pigs and pick up the truffles as often as you can. You can make them into truffle oil if you want. However, I always choose the foraging profession that makes all foraged items iridium quality, and I find that the value increase for making iridium truffles into oil is so small that it's not worth the time. I just sell them as-is.</li>
	<li><b>Skull Cavern:</b> Once you get Qi's challenge to reach level 100 of Skull Cavern on hard mode, you can make a lot of money by spending the entire day in the Cavern whenever you have nothing else going on by keeping the more difficult mode turned on. It makes the mines more dangerous, but it vastly improves the loot. You can get a ton of iridium and radioactive ore, which you can smelt into bars and sell. Combine that with the blacksmithing profession to increase their value. Monsters will sometimes drop prismatic shards and galaxy souls, which can be sold for a lot once you're done upgrading everything. You can get free Qi gems from giant slimes and exchange them for more galaxy souls to sell once you've finished buying everything you need from Qi's walnut room. And mummies will drop cloth and miners treats. Not to mention all the diamonds and other gems you find. You can often make 50-70k gold in a single day just from the Cavern. To make the Cavern a little easier, fully upgrade the galaxy sword using 3 galaxy souls, enchant it with Crusader so that you can kill mummies with your sword, and forge together an iridium band, luck ring, slime charmer ring, and burglars ring. Every time you spend a full day in the cavern, use lucky food and bombs to open up staircases and shafts quickly, and ignore gems and other loot for the first 30 floors or so. Just focus on getting down fast. The further down you go, the more iridium and radioactive ore you'll find, and those are the biggest money-makers from the Caver.</li>
	<li><b>Ancient Fruit:</b> You should have (or hopefully soon have) a quality sprinkler with 8 ancient fruit plants around it in your greenhouse. Use those fruits to keep making more seeds, and slowly fill up all tillable spots on your Ginger Island farm. Eventually you'll transition from planting seasonal crops on the valley farm to entirely relying on ancient fruit crops on Ginger Island. They're perfect money-makers because they continuously regrow, requiring no maintenance, and they give fruit once per week on the exact same schedule as wine-making. Harvest the fruit, make wine. When you have enough ancient fruit planted to fill all your many kegs, you can abandon seasonal crops entirely (unless you want to plant them for fun). Maximize your output by using deluxe retaining soil on your ancient fruit so that they don't need to be watered. That way you can get rid of sprinklers and have more spaces for fruit. Ancient fruit takes an entire season to mature, so filling up your farm with a viable crop you can use for wine will take at least a few seasons.</li>
      </ol></p>

      <p><p id="friend"><b>Great Friends</b></p>
        You'll need to reach maximum hearts with everyone, so that's 8 hearts with dateable NPCs and 10 hearts with non-dateable. If you were able to follow the gift schedule in year 1, most of them should be full hearts already. There may be a few stragglers like Krobus and Dwarf, and of course Leo and Kent are met later in the game so their hearts will be very low.
      <ol type="1">
	<li><b>Kent:</b> Don't miss Kent's birthday on Spring 4. Bring him a high quality rabbit's foot, or another loved item, for a quick jump in friendship points. When he asks you for a starfruit for his anniversary, bring him your highest quality starfruit right away as it will give another nice little jump in friendship. Try to give him 2 gifts per week and talk to him any time you pass him.</li>
	<li><b>Leo:</b> Always carry one of your highest quality duck feathers when running around on Ginger Island in case you run into him. Once he moves to the Valley, make sure to go find him twice per week to give him a gift. His friendship will increase more slowly since his birthday is late in the year and he doesn't have any quests you can do for him. Just keep bringing him presents and you'll get there quickly enough.</li>
	<li><b>The Luau:</b> If you got the Botanist profession you should be getting iridium quality truffles every day. Throw one in the Luau soup for an easy friendship boost to everyone left.</li>
	<li><b>The final stardrop:</b> You'll need to marry someone or invite Krobus to be your roommate to get your last stardrop as their 12.5 heart event. If you're going the marriage route, go to the beach on the first rainy day of Spring (or any other rainy day) to buy the mermaid pendant from the creep in the bushes by the tidepools. If you're moving in with Krobus, you can get his item from the desert trader once Krobus reaches 10 hearts.</li>
      </ol></p>

    <p><p id="cook"><b>Cooking</b></p>
	You should hopefully have all the cooking ingredients you need stored up. The first day the bookseller is in town, go buy the Queen of Sauce cookbook. You'll still be missing a handful of recipes from friendship events or that need to be purchased. Figure out what you're missing and go get it if you can. Then, you can go to your kitchen and cook 1 of each recipe you haven't done yet. Personally, I like to wait until I get Qi's cooking challenge, because it gives a nice boost to completing it. But you don't have to do the cooking as part of the challenge if you don't want to.
    </p>

    <p><p id="craft"><b>Crafting</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>You're probably still missing the alien rarecrow. Check the fortune channel on the TV and when you get a day where you have very good luck, hit the casino. Bring some lucky food with you, too. You can find lucky lunch in mystery boxes, or save the one you make as part of cooking all the recipes. Although you can buy enough chips to get the rarecrow, it's much cheaper to max out your luck, just buy a few chips, and win it all at the slots. Bet the highest amount to increase your earnings faster. The day after you get the alien rarecrow you'll get a recipe for a new scarecrow in the mail.</li>
	<li>You may be missing some crafting recipes that need to be purchased. Visit Dwarf, Krobus, Robin, Pierre, Desert Trader, Island Trader, Mr. Qi, and Volcano Dwarf for all the purchased crafting recipes.</li>
	<li>Each level of mastery gives crafting recipes.</li>
	<li>You'll have to upgrade your house to have a cellar in order to get the cask recipe. Although it's an expensive upgrade, remember that it creates even more space for kegs.</li>
	<li>Keep fulfilling community board quests to get crafting recipes as rewards.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p><p id="day5"><b>Shipped Goods</b></p>
        Your list of shipped items should be almost complete by now, but there are a handful of items you're still missing. You'll need to grow a mystic seed into a tree and tap it for mystic syrup. Hatch an ostrich and sell one of its eggs. Don't forget to ship a radioactive ore and a radioactive bar. And if you haven't done it yet, you need to ship one of each year 2 crop: garlic, cabbage, and artichoke.
