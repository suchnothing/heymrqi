    <h2>GINGER ISLAND GUIDE</h2>

      <p><p id="generaladvice"><b>General Advice</b></p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>Follow the steps in order, as the different parts of the island unlock in a specific order.</li>
      <li>The main goal here is to get to 100 golden walnuts as quickly as possible so that you can open up Qi's Walnut Room and start doing his weekly challenges. There are several important recipes that can help you reach perfection faster, and you need Qi gems to buy them.</li>
      <li>Every time it rains look for one of the gem birds. The more gems you know the placement of, the easier it is to solve the gem puzzle in the jungle. But even with just 1 correct gem placement, it's pretty easy to guess the rest.</li>
      <li>Every time you see a coconut in a tree, grab it and keep it to trade for golden coconuts. There will be new coconuts each day.</li>
      <li>Although you'll most likely need to buy a mango and banana tree from the trader, it's possible to find saplings from other sources, especially golden coconuts. Make sure to break open your first batch of golden coconuts from the trader before getting saplings from him, just in case you get some free ones. If you don't get the saplings from the golden coconuts, you can go crawling back to the trader to get them. Plant one of each sapling in your greenhouse as soon as you can after you get them. You can sell any other saplings you find, unless you really want to plant them somewhere as decoration. I like to plant ancient fruit on every tillable spot on the island farm so I don't keep the saplings.</li>
      </ol></p>

      <p><p id="east1"><b>Island East</b></p>
      <ol type="1">
	<li>Follow Leo into the jungle.</li>
	<li>Get the obvious walnut from the bush.</li>
	<li>Cut all the grass, pick up the fiddlehead fern (you can sell this later), and grab the tent kits.</li>
	<li>Follow the path to the right, into the gem statue area and get another walnut off a bush. It's partially obscured at the very bottom.</li>
	<li>Go back the way you came and head into Leo's house. Use your axe to break open the small tree inside. Give the parrot a walnut.</li>
	<li>Head back to the beach area.</li>
      </ol></p>

      <p><p id="north1"><b>Trading Post</b></p>
      <ol type="1">
	<li>Follow flame to the North.</li>
	<li>Use your hoe to dig up the little stone circle immediately to your left.</li>
	<li>Go behind the bendy palm tree further to the left, and into trees for a walnut.</li>
	<li>Dig up the little grass square spot next to hardwood tree.</li>
	<li>Chop down the hardwood tree.</li>
	<li>Take the south passage behind the big tree for a walnut.</li>
	<li>Come back up and head to your right. Dig up the little stone circle next to the coconut tree.</li>
	<li>Continue to walk north.</li>
      </ol></p>

    <p><p id="north2"><b>Field Office</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>Dig up the weird square spot in the sand right before the path turns left again, before the field office tent.</li>
	<li>Continue north towards the volcano and get the walnut that’s on a bush hiding behind a coconut tree to the right of volcano entrance.</li>
	<li>Dig up the rock semicircle near the taxi.</li>
	<li>Shoot down walnut on the palm tree above the taxi (fun tip, if you forgot to bring stones for ammo you can use a coconut).</li>
	<li>Go to the other side of the volcano entrance and dig up the stone circle next to the Joja bird.</li>
	<li>Go west through the secret passage to get a walnut.</li>
	<li>Go inside the volcano and use your watering can to make a path over the lava to the left. At the end of the lava stream there's a cave exit to more walnuts.</li>
	<li>Exit the volcano. You'll be back later.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p><p id="west1"><b>Island Farm</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>Go back to the beach and pay an army of parrots to harass the giant turtle.</li>
	<li>Place the extra chest you brought next to the house. Clear a little spot there to plant the 3 seeds you brought and put a sprinkler down for them. Don't forget to fertilize the melon. If you've found any pineapple, plant it next to the sprinkler. If you've found any taro tubers, plant them next to the river. Leave yourself a little bit of time at the end of each day to go back to the river and plant any new taro tubers you've found. You'll need to harvest stuff to get 5 walnuts, and the tubers are perfect.</li>
	<li>Put all your coconuts, the scythe, the slingshot (if you don't want to carry it), and any ginger you've dug up into the chest.</li>
	<li>Go south to the shore and break all the mussel rocks. Keep the mussels. You can store them in the chest.</li>
	<li>Dig up the walnut between the blue stars on the mussel beach.</li>
	<li>Shake any beach palm trees that have coconuts.</li>
	<li>Follow the little sand path into the pirate ship for a walnut.</li>
	<li>Go to the left across the bridge.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p><p id="west2"><b>Birdie's Hut</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>Use your extended watering can ability to snipe the cool little duggie.</li>
	<li>Dig up the X spot by the tide pools, as well as the spot between the starfish and between the little divots in the sand.</li>
	<li>Dig up all the ginger and make sure to break the tilled spots with your pickaxe so the ginger can re-grow. Shake all the trees with coconuts.</li>
	<li>Get the walnut hiding behind a coconut tree.</li>
	<li>Talk to the pirate’s wife to get the quest item from her. You'll have to bring the photo back to the valley with you and keep it until Spring.</li>
	<li>Pickup the walnut next to Qi’s cave, then scooch up along the shore to the left for another walnut.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p><p id="west3"><b>The Cliffs</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>Go north up the stairs from Birdie's Hut and kill all the tiger slime. If they don't drop a walnut, you'll have to come back every day to kill them again until they do.</li>
	<li>Chop down the hardwood trees. You'll find a walnut bush behind one and a square to dig up behind the other.</li>
	<li>Take the path down and to the right along the top of the cliff. You'll have to break rocks to get all the way through to the walnut.</li>
	<li>Go back the way you came and take the path up and to the right. Get the walnut hiding behind the foliage and chop down the hardwood tree.</li>
	<li>Go into the cave entrance partially hidden behind a tree, and beat the simon says mini game. If you struggle with this simple game like I do, and you don’t get it in three tries, move on and come back another day when you have lots of time.</li>
	<li>Cross the bridge and take the path immediately down along the top of the cliff to get a walnut.</li>
	<li>Go back up and to the right, and dig up the spot between the white flowers.</li>
	<li>Follow line of lighter green foliage to the right through the trees for a hidden walnut.</li>
	<li>Put coconuts, mussels, and ginger in your chest before leaving the area.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p><p id="north3"><b>Dig Site</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>Go back to the field office in the north part of the island.</li>
	<li>Pay the parrot to fix the bridge.</li>
	<li>If you hear any panning spots appear while you're here, pan them right away. Keep doing that until you get the fossilized tail. You can stop panning once you've found it.</li>
	<li>Bomb open the cave to release Blathers, I mean Professor Snail, from his damp, fungus infested prison.</li>
	<li>Break all the fossil spots and rocks in the dig site, cut all the fiber, harvest the ginger (you don’t need to break the tilled spots here) and chop down the hardwood trees.</li>
	<li>Head North up the stairs and dig up the circle and any ginger.</li>
	<li>Get the walnut across the bridge to the left.</li>
	<li>Head East through the secret path to get the walnuts up on the cliffs.</li>
	<li>Fish at the dig site until you fish up the fossilized spine.</li>
	<li>Go into the field office tent and donate any specimens you've found.</li>
	<li>Answer the research questions on the board. The answers will always be 22 purple flowers and 18 purple starfish.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p><p id="north4"><b>Volcano</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>Before entering the volcano, go back to the island farm and unlock the sleep hut. You can now sleep over any time you want!</li>
	<li>Drop off everything you don't need in the chest you left at the island farmhouse. You'll only need your sword, pickaxe, watering can, and some food. I also like to always keep my hoe with me, just in case.</li>
	<li>If you're sleeping overnight, you may want to bring one of the tent kits you picked up in the jungle as well, so you can set it up outside the volcano entrance at bedtime. This will maximize your time in the volcano.</li>
	<li>Do not pay the parrot at the entrance yet. There are more important things to unlock first, and you can get this one later.</li>
	<li>Try to get to level 5 of the volcano as quickly as you can, but always take time to kill the lava monsters, pick up dragon teeth from the ground, break crates, and open chests.</li>
	<li>When you get to level 5, pay the parrot to open the shortcut. Buy the warp totem and ginger ale recipes from the shop. Whenever you manage to save up enough diamonds, you'll have to come back and trade for the book. I also recommend trading for the cinderclown shoes, but pay for your weapon and tool upgrades first. The cinderclown shoes may be annoying, but they're powerful.</li>
	<li>If you have time, continue on to the caldera. Entering level 6 before 6PM is usually a safe bet. After that, you're unlikely to have enough time to get to the end. If it's too late in the day, explore level 6 and then backtrack to break all the rocks and kill all the monsters in the previous levels. You can get to the caldera on a day when you start early in the morning.</li>
	<li>When you finally reach the caldera, pick up the walnuts at the front of the cave and just outside it, and open up the shortcut.</li>
	<li>When you get a chance, and have a good number of cinder shards and prismatic shards saved up, come back to enchant your sword and tools. For the sword in particular, I highly recommend re-enchanting until you get the mummy slaying enchantment. Being able to kill them without using bombs massively speeds up Skull Cave runs and allows you to loot insane amounts of cloth that you can sell. Finish enchanting the sword first before you move on to your tools. For your tools, take a look at what's available and choose what you like best.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p><p id="south1"><b>Pirate's Cove</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>Make a quick little side trip into the jungle to cut any new fiber and visit Leo's hut for the cut scene. Once Leo starts wandering around the island, try to give him a duck feather or mango whenever you can.</li>
	<li>After a few trips through the volcano you should have enough walnuts to unlock the Pirate's Cove. Pay the parrot to build the beach resort. The first time you notice Gus visiting the resort, buy the recipe and a bottle of wine for the Joja bundle.</li>
	<li>Head east to the Pirate Cove and fish in the middle of the big star-shaped pool for a walnut.</li>
	<li>Dig up a walnut inside the yellow stars on the sand.</li>
	<li>Go inside the cave and dig up the spot between the 3 barrels close to the water.</li>
	<li>Fish until you catch a stingray.</li>
	<li>The next non-rainy, even-numbered day come back to the cave after 8PM and beat the pirate at darts 3 times to earn more walnuts.</li>
	<li>The next rainy day, bring 5 flute blocks (you'll have to craft 4 and bring the free one from the museum), place them down, and tune them to play a song for the mermaid.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p><p id="finish"><b>Finishing Up</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>As soon as you have 20 walnuts, bring all your coconuts (not including the ones put aside for crafting and building) and unlock the island trader. Trade the coconuts for golden coconuts and take them to Clint to break open the next time you're in the Valley. The most important thing to get from the trader is the deluxe retaining soil, which you will use in your greenhouse and on your island farm. Get the other recipes and saplings whenever you're able to.</li>
	<li>Clear all the weeds, wood, and stone from the island farm. You'll have to come back to manage it once per week, as the weeds return every Monday.</li>
	<li>You should plant 3 rows of taro tubers along the river, and 2 or 3 rows of pineapple along the taro tubers. Having these crops ready will make it easier to complete Qi's cooking quest or Caroline's tropical ingredients quest. They're also worth decent money. Don't put any fertilizer on the pineapple, as you will need to put deluxe retaining soil as soon as you're able to eliminate the need for sprinklers. The rest of the island farm will eventually be covered in ancient fruit, the most profitable crop, also with deluxe retaining soil. It's not very pretty, but you've got 13 million gold to make to reach perfection.</li>
	<li>Hopefully you've had at least 1 rainy day on the island and now know the position of at least 1 gem at the gem puzzle in the jungle. Go there now and figure out the other gems by switching them out systematically until you get the right combo. As long as you have at least one gem in the correct place, it's pretty quick and easy to figure out the rest through trial and error without waiting for more rainy days.</li>
	<li>When the 3 seeds you planted at the start are fully grown, complete Gormund's quests.</li>
	<li>When your banana sapling is finally ready, bring a banana to the alter in the jungle to lure out the chill gorilla. He has walnuts for you.</li>
	<li>Keep cutting grass in the jungle until you get the mummified frog, and breaking rocks on the mussel beach until you've gotten 5 golden walnuts and 2 snake vertebrae.</li>
	<li>Once all the fossils are donated to field research tent, you'll get a crafting recipe for an ostrich egg incubator. The location of your first ostrich egg is found in one of the journal scraps you find around the island. When you get the egg, craft an incubator and hatch it. Once you have an ostrich, you can put one egg in the shipping bin, incubate more eggs to hatch enough ostriches to fill your first barn, and after those 2 items of business are done you can make all future ostrich eggs into mayo to sell.</li>
	<li>If you haven't gotten 5 walnuts from fishing, spend some time fishing off the dock or the beach until you get them all.</li>
	<li>There are a lot of walnuts in the volcano, so keep going back until you've gotten them all. You'll have to go back often anyways, since you need a lot of cinder shards to complete all your upgrades and crafting recipes.</li>
	<li>As you manage to find enough walnuts, unlock the taxi, the warp totem, the volcano bridge, and the island farm mailbox.</li>
	<li>Once everything is unlocked, you'll have a few final walnuts to trade to Mr. Qi for Qi gems.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p><p id="walnut"><b>Qi's Walnut Room</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>As soon as you reach 100 golden walnuts, open Qi's Walnut Room so you can start doing weekly quests from Qi. Prioritize the quests that reset the mine and make the Skull Cavern more difficult, as those ones make radioactive ore available. After that, complete whatever quest you think will be easiest.</li>
	<li>Under no circumstance should you choose the Qi's Special Crop quest. It's impossible without copius amounts of speed-gro and will eat up all of your time. It's not worth it. Not doing any quest at all is better than trying to grow Qi's Nightmare Crop.</li>
	<li>Once you start collecting Qi Gems, you can go shopping. Buy Pierre's produce list first, as it will allow you to use your greenhouse to grow any crops from any seasons that you missed or lost. Next, buy the heavy tapper recipe and replace your oak resin tappers with heavy tappers. Also place heavy tappers on any mystic trees you grow. Your other trees can keep regular tappers, as you don't really need their products.</li>
	<li>You can get the rest of the stuff there in whatever order you want. If you love cave diving then I recommend you don't waste your gems on galaxy souls, as you can often find them for free when the caves are set to hard mode.</li>
    </ol></p>
