    <h2>FALL GUIDE</h2>

      <p><p id="generaladvice"><b>General Advice</b></p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>If Jodi asks you to bring a largemouth bass, wait until Year 2 and do it when Kent is back.</li>
      <li>The first rainy day, go fishing in the river for walleye. If you catch an iridium one, keep it for the stardew 	valley fair.</li>
      <li>As you collect forage items, make sure to keep 5 common mushrooms for the dehydrator. All 5 need to be the same quality.</li>
      <li>At least one broccoli needs to go in the shipping bin, but you can sell the rest or pickle it to give to Harvey. Be careful not to use up too many preserves jars, as you'll need to make caviar with your sturgeon roe as well.</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on your friendship levels this month. If you reach max hearts with someone, stop giving them gifts even if the guide says to. If you're keeping items specifically to gift to them, like flowers, you can sell the remaining ones.</li> 
     </ol></p>

      <p><p id="day1"><b>Fall 1, Monday</b></p>
      <ol type="1">
	<li>Craft 2 more furnaces, and fill all 4 furnaces with copper.</li>
	<li>You’ll need 11 sprinklers to fit the seeds for this month, so if you don't have that many already, craft enough now and place them. Clear out any dead plants and weeds, and till/water all the spaces around the sprinkler. It shouldn't take long with your upgraded tools.</li>
	<li>Harvest wheat, and plant 8 more around the same sprinkler.</li>
	<li>Craft another mayo machine and grab one of the small chests left from earlier. Put it with the other machines, and place a chest next to it. Ducks provide eggs every other day, so you will be turning one into mayo on the day you collect it, and saving the other in the chest to do on the off-day.</li>
	<li>For today, put one duck egg in the mayo machine, and put the other one in the shipping bin.</li>
	<li>Put the milk from your cows into the cheese presses. Put the cheese from yesterday into your cooking chest.</li>
	<li>Collect pine tar from the tapped trees and put it in your crafting chest.</li>
	<li>Fill your furnaces with iron.</li>
	<li>Go to Pierre's and buy 24 pumpkin (or 15 if you got the 9 free pumpkin seeds from the museum), 1 eggplant, 2 bok choy, 19 yam, 1 cranberry, 16 wheat, 8 fairy seeds, and 3 amaranth.</li>
        <li>Go back to your farm and pull out 16 of the beet seeds and the two rare seeds you bought earlier.</li>
	<li>Plant the 8 fairy seeds on an outer sprinkler, keeping in mind that you will be putting bee houses next to them. Plant 16 beets and all the pumpkin seeds. Plant the bok choy, amaranth, and 3 of the yam on the same sprinkler. Save the other yam seeds. Plant the eggplant, cranberry, and rare seeds on the same sprinkler, along with 4 broccoli. If you haven't found 6 broccoli seeds yet, keep those spots open and plant them as you find them. Plant the 2 rare seeds on their own sprinkler. If you want, you can put more wheat or broccoli in the empty spots around that sprinkler, but you don't have to, and it won't be tracked in this guide.</li>
	<li>Put your highest quality fertilizer on the pumpkins. If you run out, craft some normal quality fertilizer using sap to fertilize the rest of the pumpkins. Also fertilize the fairy rose, the rare seeds, and the broccoli. Don't fertilize anything else.</li>
	<li>Fill your furnaces with copper.</li>
	<li>Craft 2 bee houses and place them as close to the fairy rose as you can. Don’t harvest the fairy rose until the end of the season so that your bees can make fancy expensive honey.</li>
	<li>Find a spot on your farm that you don't plan to use in the immediate future and absolutely fill it up with tree seeds. You are going to need a lot of wood. So much wood.</li>
	<li>Fill your furnaces with iron.</li>
	<li>If you have time, go to the mountain to collect stone and catch a midnight carp. The carp doesn't come out until 10PM, so you may need to gather stone, take a break to catch the carp, and then go back to gathering stone.</li>
      </ol></p>

      <p><p id="day2"><b>Fall 2, Tuesday</b> (Penny's Birthday)</p>
      <ol type="1">
	<li>Fill furnaces with copper.</li>
	<li>Craft 2 kegs and make 2 pale ales.</li>
	<li>Put the duck mayo in the shipping bin.</li>
	<li>Put the milk from your cows into the cheese presses. Put the two cheese from yesterday into your cooking chest. You should now have three cheese for cooking.</li>
	<li>Fill furnaces with iron.</li>
	<li>Pack your bag with: Fishing rod, axe, hoe, food, pickaxe, 5 gold bars, and gifts for Evelyn, George, Pierre, Caroline, Abigail, Maru, Harvey, Lewis, Alex, Clint, Jas, Vincent, and Penny. If you have museum donations or geodes (don't forget to save 1 frozen geode), bring those as well.</li>
	<li>Give gifts to Evelyn, George, and Alex at their house.</li>
        <li>Give gifts to Pierre, Caroline, and Abigail at the general store.</li>
        <li>Give gifts to Maru and Harvey at the clinic.</li>
        <li>Give a gift to Lewis outside his house.</li>
	<li>Check the new community board for quests. Always accept a quest, but only complete it if you have time. Look at what you're doing for the week and try to accept a quest that most closely aligns with what is already planned.</li>
	<li>If you don't have at least 250 stone in storage, try to gather it before Clint's closes, as you'll need it tomorrow and don't want to get caught with only 100 stone and no pickaxe like I did.</li>
	<li>Go to Clint's and upgrade your pickaxe to gold. Open geodes if you brought them.</li>
	<li>Give a gift to Clint.</li>
	<li>Give museum donations if you have any.</li>
	<li>Give a gift to Penny, Jas, and Vincent.</li>
	<li>Catch Angler.</li>
	<li>Gather wood from around the valley for the rest of the day. You'll need 1050 wood and 500 stone for the barn and coop upgrades. If you already have enough, still collect more wood as you'll need it for crafting as well.</li>
	<li>Put Angler in the smoker before you go to bed.</li>
      </ol></p>

    <p><p id="day3"><b>Fall 3, Wednesday</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
	<li>Fill furnaces with copper.</li>
	<li>Craft another cheese press and grab one of the small chests left from earlier. Put it with the other presses, and place a chest next to it. Goats are milked every other day, so you will be turning one into cheese on the day you collect it, and saving the other in the chest to do on the off-day.</li>
	<li>Harvest apples and put them in your donations chest.</li>
        <li>Put one duck egg in a mayo machine and one in your donations chest.</li>
	<li>You should be getting large milk now. Put one in the shipping bin and the other in your donations chest. Put one cheese into your donations chest and sell the other one. Going forward, make all milk into cheese and sell it (don't forget to save 1 gold star quality for the fair).</li>
        <li>If your goats have matured today, milk them. Put one goat milk in the shipping bin and one in the cheese press.</li>
	<li>Fill your furnaces with iron.</li>
	<li>Pack your bag with: Fishing rod, hoe, 500 wood, 200 stone, and gifts for Robin, Sebastian, Demetrius, Linus, and Dwarf.</li>
	<li>Go to Robin's and build a deluxe coop.</li>
	<li>Give Robin a gift, then go down to Sebastian's room to give him a gift as well.</li>
	<li>Find Demertius and Linus outside and give them a gift.</li>
	<li>Give Dwarf a gift.</li>
	<li>Go fishing at the waterfalls in the Cindersap Forest for a goby. Once you've caught one, fish at the Cindersap river for tiger trout until 6 PM. If you don't have at least 550 wood in storage, then fish until you catch one tiger trout and then chop wood until 6PM.</li>
	<li>At 6PM, switch to the ocean to fish for albacore and other ocean fish. Pick up your crab pots on your way to the docks. You'll be moving them to a new location.</li>
	<li>Around 11:30PM stop fishing and go place your crab pots in the river close to Clint's and fill them with bait. Keep refilling them every time you go by until you have the snails and periwinkle you need. Once you have all the crab pot fish, you can put the crab pots away or move them back to the ocean to gather extra lobster for Elliot.</li>
	<li>Go home to bed. Keep two of your highest quality sea cucumber for Wizard.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p><p id="day4"><b>Fall 4, Thursday</b></p>

	<li>Collect oak resin and put it in your crafting chest.</li>
	<li>Hopefully you've found a dinosaur egg by now. Put it in the incubator in the coop. Technically, you could have done this after the previous coop upgrade, but they're rare to find so I assumed you may not have gotten one yet.</li>

If you find a pristmatic shard, immediately take it to the triangle of pillars outside the Cavern and turn it into a Galaxy Sword. It'll make exploring the Cavern a lot easier.</li>

        <li>If you don’t have two extra quality sprinklers, craft them now to keep the greenhouse crops watered. Also craft a seedmaker to put in or near the greenhouse.</li>
        <li>Inside the greenhouse, plant ancient seeds and fruit tree saplings if you have them. You’ll want one of each sapling and 8 ancient fruit plants in the greenhouse.</li>
	<li>If you got the seeds/items for the Year 2 crops from the travelling cart, plant them in the greenhouse around your second sprinkler and put your highest quality Speed-Gro fertilizer on them. You will need 5 red cabbage, 3 artichoke, 4 garlic, and one extra garlic seed to plant on Ginger Island. If you don't have enough, put the products you grew or bought into the seedmaker to make new seeds. Hopefully you'll get multiple seeds from one product. Keep making seeds and regrowing until you have enough of each item. If you're still missing any seeds, continue checking the travelling cart and plant any you get as soon as you find them.</li>
	<li>Craft as many kegs as you can and place them in the greenhouse, taking care not to put them too close to your fruit saplings. Brew your normal quality pumpkins in the greenhouse kegs if you have them. If you have any pumpkins left over, save them to put in the kegs when this batch is done brewing. If you have no pumpkins to brew, you can brew any extra hops you have from the summer and sell the IPA.</li>
	<li>Harvest your corn and save it for making oil.</li>
	<li>Collect cloth and save it for crafting. If you already have enough cloth saved you can sell any cloth you make.</li>

Talk to everyone, put your items in the display, then talk to Mayor Lewis to be judged.</li>
	<li>Once you have your winnings, play the fishing or slingshot game a bunch to get the rest of the tokens you need so you can buy the stardrop and rarecrow. It’s not a bad idea to get enough tokens to also buy the prize ticket. You can also get anything else you feel like.</li>
	<li>Pick up your grange display items. Anything you don’t pick up can be retrieved from the lost and found box in the Mayor’s house later. If you included a diamond in the grange display, don't sell it. Save it to give to Marnie on her birthday.</li>
